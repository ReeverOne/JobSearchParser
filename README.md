# JobSearchParser
Search specific company websites for a 'career' page, search open positions for a specific job title, and outputs a summary of the job description.

This is a work in progress and is in no way guaranteed to work for your specific needs. Especially considering that I am not a developer.

Basic Functionality:
Enter a single URL or a list of URLs to parse
Search for the job opening page (typically searching visable URLs for 'career')
Search the returned URL for open positions
Summarize the requirements of the open position
Provide a link to apply for the position

Dreams for v2
Add AI abilities to prioritize requirements to customize your resume
Auto apply to position
