        "requirements": "Who We Are\nAre you ready to suit up?\n\n\nWe intentionally hire a broad set of personalities, and we want everyone to be their genuine, authentic self. We\u2019re looking for passionate people that are interested in a wide variety of stuff beyond work (we know you're already interested in work, that's the whole point).\n\n\nWe really don\u2019t mind \nwhat\n you\u2019re interested in, we mind that you're interested. Maybe you\u2019re into gardening. Yep, we talk spring planting schedules. Discontinued TV shows from the \u201980s, we\u2019re deep into them. Chicken wings, beer, air fryers, we have the recipes you want. Darin has a \nVERY\n strong obsession with KISS. We have Slack groups for sports fans AND for people that don\u2019t like sports. We run the gamut. We\u2019re just looking to support each Titan\u2019s wild and wacky interests. If you\u2019re into something, we want to hear it. Chances are, someone is into it too.\n\n\nWe like to say \"\nWe take our work seriously but refuse to take ourselves seriously.\n\" But we DO expect everyone to demonstrate POTIS every day, in their own way. It's how we hold ourselves and our fellow Titans accountable. What's POTIS you say?\n\n\nP.O.T.I.S.\n\n\nThere are 5 traits every Titan must possess, in their own authentic fashion.\n\n\n\nWhy work at Irish Titan?\n\n\n\n\nA Pretty Killer Office\n\nSeriously, TitanHQ (aka the mothership) is fabulous, especially if you like green. You like green, right?\n\n\n\n\nInsurance and Retirement\n\nMedical, disability, life, 401k,  All that normal stuff you need to live. We\u2019ve got you covered. (Covered. Get it? Whatever.)\n\n\n\n\nFlexible Schedule\n\nWe like to treat people like adults who earn the right to be treated like adults. \nActually\n flexible. Demonstrate POTIS, and you earn some flexibility.\n\n\n\n\nWe Take Lunch Seriously\n\nFood truck Thursdays, recipe dedicated Slack channels, lunch trains, and next-level birthday treats; It\u2019s all a big deal here. Our lunch game is strong.\n\n\n\n\nCoffee, La Croix, and Beer\n\nFree coffee? Tick. Free La Croix? Tick. (Pop too, we don\u2019t judge) Free beer (wine, whiskey, etc)? Tick (but usually later in the day). Remember...we're Irish Titan, not \nAmish Titan\n (no offense, they're great bowlers).\n\n\n\n\nPet-First Environment\n\nThough we have yet to see a cat (there\u2019s still time), we have our dogs here just about every day. Not a cat/dog/llama lover? We have safe rooms for that.\n\n\n\n\nSit/Stand Desks\n\nSit or stand. Your desk, your choice. No forms to fill. No applications to complete. No questions to answer. We haven't seen Darin sit at his desk in years.\n\n\n\n\nField Trips & Company Parties\n\nGet out of here! Seriously leave. From time to time we just encourage everyone to get out of the office and go have some management approved, officially sanctioned fun. Boxing. Puzzle Rooms. Massages. Fun is good. We like fun. We even have a mandatory, month-long sabbatical after 5 years. Hows that for making you leave.\n\n\n\n\nThe Batpole\n\nThe quickest way downstairs and the longest way back up. It can be done. We've seen it done twice. We even have a Batpole waiver form. Again, not a typo, there is a two story batpole in our office.\n\n\n\n\nRecognition and Swag\n\nCompany kudos, \nreal\n recognition for your work, team-focused attitudes, and managers that works for you. Give your coworkers tha kudos they deserve. We\u2019re not unique here, just good at celebrating. New Titans also get a ton of swag. You like green, right?\n\n\nOur Team Structure\n\n\nWe're the sum of our parts. Plus a little more.\n\n\n\n\nSALES\n Making the wheels of industry turn and keeping us all in our jobs (Their words).\n\n\nMARKETING\n \nActually\n write the words, plan the events, and even make all our newsletter links green. Attract, convert, delight. All that.\n\n\nACCOUNT MANAGEMENT\n Our \"relationship whisperers\". Remember; partnerships, not transactions.\n\n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\n Orchestrating and delivering all of our B1O2 experiences.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE MARKETING\n Data-driven geniuses (citation needed) charting a client's course to digital domination.\n\n\nCREATIVE (UI, UX)\n Experts in design, content, form and function...and coffee. It's a creative thing.\n\n\nFRONTEND DEV\n At the coalface, laying the groundwork for success. Don't tell Backend we said that.\n\n\nBACKEND DEV\n At the coalface, laying the ground work for success. Don't tell Frontend we said that.\n\n\nOPERATIONS\n \"Everything\" seems a little broad, but it's not far off the mark.\n\n\nWant to know more?\nRead about Our Culture"

        "requirements": "We found the cure for WVS (White Van Syndrome)! The doctors name is Dan Antonelli!  The prescription was a complete overhaul for our 54 year old business (Tuck & Howell).  It all started when I spoke to a friend of mine that hired Kickcharge to brand his business (Bullseye in Sarasota, FL.).  He recommended that I read the book Branded Not Blanded.  I was actually working for a company and had been telling my wife that I want to go out on my own....  I have been in the business my whole life and wanted to start my own business but I was missing something.  The book made it all come together for me.  The proverbial light bulb went off in my head the moment I read the book.  I had an opportunity to buy my family's business and it was right after reading Dan's book.The reason I keep referencing the book is because when a contractor thinks about a complete overhaul of their brand, they think \"oh my gosh that's way too expensive\".  The fact of the matter is that it's a hell of a lot more expensive not to do it!  That's the absolute facts!An amazing phenomenon about rebranding is that not only do you get to increase revenue by attracting more customers but you will attract potential employees!  YES I SAID THAT!  There is a huge shortage in this industry for technicians and installers as everyone knows.  The fact of the matter is that technicians like to feel proud of the company they work for.  They like to pull up to the house driving a wrapped vehicle with some cool and sticky branding, walk up to the door wearing a uniform matching the vehicle, handing the home owner a business card that matches as well!  These guys don't like driving a clunker, wearing a t-shirt with clip art on the left chest, and handing them a card that they designed on vistaprint!Ask for Erica and Gina as your project managers!  They are absolute Rockstars!  Very responsive, knowledgeable and professional!  Going through a rebrand there is a lot of communication and having someone that stays on top of things is extremely important not only for detail but timing.  These 2 gals are some of the best I have ever seen!  I don't know where they found them but they are lucky to have them!Get with the program!  Read the Branded Not Blanded Book, and more importantly #GETKICKCHARGED!"
